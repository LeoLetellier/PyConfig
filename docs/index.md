    Master your Python installation: make your code easily reproducible and self-contained, don't ever fight with your dependencies and your broken installation

    Write clear code: less development time, easier to find bugs and even go back on older code without a headache

    Leave a trace of what you once tried to accomplish. Your older self and co-workers will thank you for that

    Handle large files graciously by taking the best out of Python's libraries

    Design efficient Command Line Interfaces so that people launch your cool stuff in the shell

-   :material-share-all:{ .lg .middle } __Share your Code__

    Because sharing is caring (is it?), cook a nice integrated documentation for your team and your community

    Make easily reproducible and self-contained code, don't ever fight with your dependencies and your broken installation

    [:octicons-arrow-right-24: Master your Installation](python-setup/uv/intro.md)

-   :material-quality-high:{ .lg .middle } __Code Quality__
    
    ---

    Write clear code so you can go back on older code without a headache

    [:octicons-arrow-right-24: Sharpen your codebase](code-quality/types.md)

-   :material-database:{ .lg .middle } __Big Data__
    
    ---

    Handle large files graciously by taking the best out of Python's libraries

    [:octicons-arrow-right-24: Compute on TBs](big-data/numpy.md)

-   :material-file-document-check-outline:{ .lg .middle } __Documentation__
    
    ---

    Leave a trace of what you once tried to accomplish for your older self and your team

    [:octicons-arrow-right-24: Ready your plume](documentation/docstrings.md)

-   :material-console:{ .lg .middle } __CLI__
    
    ---

    Design efficient Command Line Interfaces so that people launch your cool stuff in the shell

    [:octicons-arrow-right-24: Launch now](cli/typer.md)

-   :material-share-all:{ .lg .middle } __Share your Code__
    
    ---

    Because sharing is caring (is it?), cook a nice integrated documentation for your team and your community

# Mkdocs

[MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) is a static site generator from MarkDown text as source code / page content.

[Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) use web resources (fonts, icons, ...) to integrate MkDocs in a modern site template.

Multiple plugins can be added and used to customize the functionnalities and themes of the site.

Docstrings can be extracted for MkDocs using [mkdocstrings](https://mkdocstrings.github.io/).

The present website has been generated using Material for MkDocs. Pretty cool, isn't it ?
